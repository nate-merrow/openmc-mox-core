# Overview

This project is one simulates a 2x1 miniature core with two 17 x 17 fuel arrays, one of which uses depleted UO2 as fuel and the other of which uses PuO2.
The script for this project is found in the notebooks/mox_and_uo2_comparison.py file.
The current outputs for this file consist of a tallies.out file with tallies of the uranium and plutnium fuel reactions as well as the reaction rates of the entire array.

# What next?

In the future, I'd like to try comparing mox fuels with different PuO2 enrichments to see how it affects the fuel reactions and k-effective for the mini core
